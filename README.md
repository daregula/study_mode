# study_mode
chrome extension to help create a fast and easy study environment

- Enter your links into the field and set the day and times you want them to be active so when you click "study mode" all links set for that time will open.
- I also attatched a mini timer that you can use for whatever and edit your scheduled links if you want to change their active day and times.
